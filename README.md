## Description
This is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and display current weather along with a five day forecast for user entered cities. The weather dashboard is created using dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It utilizes a 3rd party API to retrieve weather information [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Use
The default display shows Seattle weather information. The user can enter a city name and the display will update with current weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, uv rating) and a 5 day forecast. Searched cities are stored and displayed in a list on the left side of the page. The user can click on a city in the prior query list and the weather for that city will display. The user can also clear the list of cities queried.
